# Capstone Project Overview

The capstone project integrates all concepts learned throughout the course into a comprehensive autonomous humanoid robot system. This project demonstrates the full pipeline from perception to action in a complex, real-world scenario.

## Project Goals

The capstone project aims to:

- Integrate ROS2, simulation, Isaac, and VLA components
- Demonstrate autonomous humanoid behavior
- Apply perception, planning, and control techniques
- Showcase human-robot interaction capabilities
- Validate the entire technology stack

## System Architecture

The complete system architecture includes:

- **Perception layer**: Vision, language, and sensor processing
- **Planning layer**: Task planning and motion planning
- **Control layer**: Low-level robot control
- **Human interface**: Natural language interaction

## Key Components

The system integrates:

- **Navigation**: Autonomous movement through complex environments
- **Manipulation**: Object identification and manipulation
- **Interaction**: Natural language understanding and response
- **Learning**: Adaptation to new situations and tasks
- **Safety**: Fail-safe mechanisms and emergency procedures

## Implementation Phases

The project is developed in phases:

1. **Component validation**: Testing individual system components
2. **Integration**: Connecting components into a unified system
3. **Testing**: Validation in simulation environments
4. **Deployment**: Running on physical or simulated humanoid robots
5. **Evaluation**: Assessment of system performance and capabilities

## Success Metrics

The project will be evaluated based on:

- **Task completion**: Successfully executing specified tasks
