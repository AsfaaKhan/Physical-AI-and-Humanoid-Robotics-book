# What is Physical AI

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with the physical world, enabling machines to perceive, reason, and act in real-world environments. Unlike traditional AI that operates in virtual spaces, Physical AI systems must navigate the complexities of physics, uncertainty, and embodied interaction.

## Key Characteristics

Physical AI systems are characterized by:

- **Embodiment**: Having a physical form that interacts with the environment
- **Real-time Processing**: Making decisions under temporal constraints
- **Sensorimotor Integration**: Combining perception and action seamlessly
- **Environmental Interaction**: Direct manipulation of physical objects and spaces

## Applications in Robotics

Physical AI finds its most compelling expression in robotics, where intelligent systems must operate in unstructured environments. From industrial automation to humanoid assistants, these systems demonstrate the potential of AI when grounded in physical reality.

## Challenges

The primary challenges in Physical AI include dealing with uncertainty, partial observability, and the need for robust, safe interactions with the physical world. These challenges require specialized approaches that differ significantly from traditional AI methods.
