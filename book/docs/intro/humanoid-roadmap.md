# Humanoid Roadmap

The development of humanoid robots represents one of the most ambitious endeavors in robotics, requiring the integration of multiple complex systems. This roadmap outlines the evolution from current research to practical humanoid applications.

## Historical Context

The pursuit of humanoid robots began in the 1970s with early mechanical designs. Since then, the field has evolved through several generations of robots, each advancing capabilities in locomotion, manipulation, and interaction.

## Current State

Modern humanoid robots like Honda's ASIMO, Boston Dynamics' Atlas, and SoftBank's Pepper demonstrate impressive capabilities in specific domains. However, widespread practical deployment remains limited by challenges in autonomy, cost, and reliability.

## Future Directions

The path toward truly autonomous humanoid robots involves advances in:

- **Perception Systems**: Enhanced vision, touch, and multi-modal sensing
- **Locomotion**: Dynamic balance and adaptive gait control
- **Manipulation**: Dexterous hands and fine motor control
- **Cognition**: Real-time decision making and learning

## Timeline

The roadmap suggests that general-purpose humanoid robots for domestic use may emerge within 10-20 years, while specialized applications will continue to expand in the near term.
